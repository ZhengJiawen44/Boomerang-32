# Boomerang-32
Boomerang-32 is a electronics project centered around an ESP32 microcontroller. I will be adding different cool and interesting features as I go along!

## Objectives
Create a handheld electronic device that has basic functionalities such as 
🔆changing screen brightness
🔋 displaying battery level
🎮 games
🤖 virtual Pets
🖥️ Network Monitor
...and more!

I will code everything from scratch using C++ so I can implement all the cool things that I wish to see!

## milestone 1:
create an interactive menu, and implement screen brightness change functionality along with battery display.
✔️ screen brightness settings persists between on/off and can be changed.
✔️ a basic menu that can be navigated by a button. (currently only one touch sensor, I have yet to acquire enough buttons).
